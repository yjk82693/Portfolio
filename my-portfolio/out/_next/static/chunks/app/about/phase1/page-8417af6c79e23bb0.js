My life was confined to familiar streets and familiar faces, and I never thought much beyond them. This changed when, unexpectedly, my parents told me that I would be going to the United States—not with them, but alone, to experience a new culture. I found myself in North Carolina for three months, living with a host family and trying to navigate a world where I barely understood the language. Adapting to this new environment was not easy. The unfamiliar language and customs were overwhelming, but over time, through my homestay experience, I gradually became more accustomed to American culture. The initial feelings of loneliness and negativity began to fade, replaced by a budding sense of curiosity and resilience. Despite this, I returned to Korea with lingering doubts, wondering, "Do I really have to do this again?"'}),(0,i.jsx)(l,{style:{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"1.8",textAlign:"justify"},children:"The following year, my family and I moved together to Williamsburg, Virginia, for a longer stay. This time, with my family by my side, I found it easier to embrace the changes. Together, we traveled around North America, and each journey brought new sights and experiences that continued to expand my worldview. The vastness and beauty of North America left a lasting impression on me, transforming my initial reluctance into a genuine appreciation. I realized how much more there was to see beyond the narrow scope of my previous life. As I discovered more of this fascinating world, I found myself longing to uncover new places and perspectives, becoming captivated by the idea of constantly seeking out the unknown."}),(0,i.jsx)(l,{style:{fontSize:"18px",lineHeight:"1.8",textAlign:"justify"},children:"Even after returning to Korea, this fascination with exploring didn’t fade.
